Transform the scene into a playful robot vision while maintaining accurate details. Add subtle neon highlights to edges and mechanical elements, with gentle glowing effects on moving parts.
Keep the original scene clearly recognizable, just enhanced with a light robotic aesthetic - like looking through slightly tinted robot eyes.
Add minimal but fun effects: small electric sparks on metal surfaces, subtle particle trails on fast movements, and a gentle holographic overlay on digital displays.
The result should feel like seeing the world through a friendly robot's eyes - maintaining reality while adding just enough robotic charm to be fun and engaging.
